  <h2 style="text-align: left;">Acrylic Paintings That Tell a Story</h2>
    <p>Painting is a way to capture both imagination and memory on canvas. With each brushstroke, I aim to create art that feels alive and invites you to step into the scene. My acrylic paintings focus on the beauty of landscapes and the power of moments in history, offering pieces that are rich in color and full of detail.</p>

      <p>The R.M.S. Titanic; One of my most meaningful works. This piece reflects not only the power and size of the ship but also the emotion of its story. Through careful detail and bold color, I wanted to honor both the beauty and the tragedy of this unforgettable time in history.</p>

  <p>From wide, rolling hills to quiet forest paths, my landscape paintings highlight the wonder of the natural world. Each piece is designed to bring peace, warmth, and a sense of place into your home. I work with vibrant acrylics to capture changing skies, glowing light, and the stillness of nature in a way that feels both timeless and inviting.</p>
