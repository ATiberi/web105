<p>Halloween is one of the coolest times of year. 
The trees have gone warm into their reds, yellows, 
and orange, while the weather has gone cold as the fall falls deeper into winter.
People begin to decorate with ghosts and skeletons, black and orange, spider webs, and more.
People are in the spirit of Halloween and they take it to its limits.</p>

<h2>Here are some of the best things about Halloween:</h2>
<wbr>

<h2>1. Pumpkins</h2>

<p class="p2">Pumpkins are essential to Halloween because of their many uses.
Pumpkins can be carved, baked, scooped, boiled, and more. They can even be used
to make candles! The best use of a pumpkin that also tastes the best is pumpkin pie.
Pumpkin pie with a ton of whipped cream is the perfect way to tie together any 
Halloween evening.

<h3>2. Skeletons</h3>

<p class="p2">Skeletons bring not only a spooky vibe to Halloween, but also a funny one.
    Skeletons can be both comedic and spooky, depending on how you use them. They're commonly
    found in front yards, haunted houses, as costumes, and even on cookies. Halloween without
    skeletons just wouldn't be the same!

<h1>3. Candy</h1>

<p cass="p2">If Halloween could be described in one word, it would be: Candy.
    Trick-or-Treating is what brings candy alive during Halloween. The best
    candy, in my opinion, is always simply chocolate. To be more specific:
    Kit-Kats, 3 Musketeers, Hereshy's, Whoppers, and Crunch bars too.
