    <h1>Page 1: About Me</h1>
        <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>Hi, my name is Andrew! I am 19 years old and live in Michigan. Creativity and curiosity shape much of who I am, and I enjoy exploring many different ways to learn and express myself. I love reading and often find myself deep in books on history, faith, and theology. Painting and writing give me a way to slow down and share what inspires me. Hobby kits and building projects let me work with my hands, while technology and coding let me solve problems and bring new ideas to life.</p>
        <h3>Inspired by Nature</h3>
            <p>Spending time outdoors is one of my favorite things. Whether I am walking through the woods, enjoying the colors of the seasons, or photographing birds and plants, nature always reminds me of God’s beauty and creativity in the world around us.</p>
        <h3>Creative Journey</h3>
            <p>Art, photography, and writing are more than just hobbies for me—they are ways to connect with people and share meaningful stories. Each project, whether it is a painting, a photograph, or a piece of code, reflects a part of who I am and what I value.</p>

        <h3>Discover the Beauty of Nature Through Photography</h3>
            <p>Photography is more than just taking pictures. It is about capturing the quiet beauty of the world around us. My work focuses on the details that often go unnoticed, whether it is the graceful flight of birds, the delicate shapes of plants, or the calming glow of the moon. Each photo tells a story, inviting you to pause, reflect, and see the world from a new perspective.</p>
        <h3>Birds, Plants, and the Moon</h3>
            <p>Birds remind us of freedom and movement, and I love freezing those moments in time when their wings catch the light just right. Plants bring a sense of life and growth, from tiny leaves to wide, sweeping landscapes. The moon adds mystery and wonder, always changing yet always present in the night sky. Together, these moments in nature reveal the beauty of God’s creation and His care for the world.</p>
        <h3>Timeless, Clean, and Natural</h3>
            <p>Every image is carefully composed with a clean, natural style. My goal is to create photos that feel both personal and timeless, pieces you will want to look at again and again. Whether you are drawn to the wildness of nature or the stillness of the night, my photography offers a simple way to bring God’s beauty into your space.</p>
        <h3>Explore the Gallery</h3>
            <p>Take a look through the collection and find the images that speak to you. You may be surprised at what you discover.</p>

        <h3>Acrylic Paintings That Tell a Story</h3>
            <p>Painting is a way to capture both imagination and memory on canvas. With each brushstroke, I aim to create art that feels alive and invites you to step into the scene. My acrylic paintings focus on the beauty of landscapes and the power of moments in history, offering pieces that are rich in color and full of detail.</p>
        <h3>Landscapes Full of Life</h3>
            <p>From wide, rolling hills to quiet forest paths, my landscape paintings highlight the wonder of the natural world. Each piece is designed to bring peace, warmth, and a sense of place into your home. I work with vibrant acrylics to capture changing skies, glowing light, and the stillness of nature in a way that feels both timeless and inviting.</p>
        <h3>The Titanic on Canvas</h3>
            <p>One of my most meaningful works is my painting of the Titanic. This piece reflects not only the power and size of the ship but also the emotion of its story. Through careful detail and bold color, I wanted to honor both the beauty and the tragedy of this unforgettable moment in history.</p>
